## How to scrum via PluralSight Course Notes


### What is "Scrum":
* Scrum is a framework that is used by teams in high agile environments that need to adapt to change quikcly, effectively, and in the most efficient way possible.
* It was built off of Empriricism: 
  * Which means that the only knowledge known is that of past experiences. 
* Scrumming uses a process of inspecting, adapting/changing, and transparancy for updates and feedback from all team members and people involved.

* **Fundamentally**, it takes a really big project or product idea, breaks it down into several increments via smaller tasks or items (by defining certain feaure sets or enhancements), and combines an iterative feedback loop for each increment added to test functionality, value add, and maintaining the quality build out of a product all under a pre-determined 'timebox' given the complexity of the task at hand.
