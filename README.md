# An Overview of Scrum :)

## How to scrum via PluralSight Course Notes


### What is "Scrum":
* Scrum is a framework that is used by teams in high agile environments that need to adapt to change quikcly, effectively, and in the most efficient way possible.
* It was built off of Empriricism: 
  * Which means that the only knowledge known is that of past experiences. 
* Scrumming uses a process of inspecting, adapting/changing, and transparancy for updates and feedback from all team members and people involved.

* Fundamentally, it takes a really big project or product idea, breaks it down into several increments via smaller tasks or items (by defining certain feaure sets or enhancements), and combines an iterative feedback loop for each increment added to test: functionality, value add, and maintaining the quality build out of a product; all under a pre-determined timebox.
 * **Timebox**: a set of schedules to be able to define and build out incremental items (features or enhancements) through a series of sprints per item (30 min, 2 days, 1 week, 2 weeks) depending on the complexity of the added item.

### The Scrum Team:
The Scrum Team in any scrum process is divided up into 3 different categories:
1. **Product Owner**: usually hired by a client or business, the source of knowledge for the product who defines and communicates the product vision with the rest of the team, and ensures the backlog accurately represents the product vision at hand
* Product Backlog: the list of items necessary for the creation and definition of the product
2. **Scrum Master**: ensures that all members are sticking to their tasks, and is there to help remove any blockers or impediments for the dev team, while maintaining strict transparency and communication with the product owner.
3. **Dev Team**: the developers who do the work and execution of the product by building out the features and enhancements defined by the product owner. Also architect, code, and test all items placed on the product log.

* **A Few Notes About the Scrum Team**:
 * They are **self-organizing**: Team members can go in and out of roles at different times throughout the scrum timebox. No one team member has authority over the other, and each hold equal authority to each other in doing the best of their job at the time available dependent on their strengths and individual abilities.
 * Need to find tightly focused products to work on intitially rather than broad ones.
 
 ### Defining Sprints:
 * **Sprint Questions**:
   * What will we deliver?
   * How will we deliver it?
   * Decide on a timebox for the sprints depending on complexity of product, not amount of features.
* **Sprint Goal**:
 * Crafted from a bottom up (from cohesive items up to a goal) or a top down (crafted from the vision down to the items).
   * Both also work well together.
 
* **Sprint Backlog**:
 - [ ] Defines the tasks
 - [ ] Defines the timebox of each task
 - [ ] Deliberates the tasks to individuals
 
* **Scrum Reviews**:
  * Held at the end of each sprint session
  * Show more than just demos, show a functional product, pre-set meeting with an agenda
  
* **Some Sprint Notes**:
 * Predictability of a sprint is the goal, not velocity
   * Velocity: the amount of items completed in a given period of time
 * Add Business Value: have a shippable product due a few sprints before finalized date of product release, but have added feature sets that add 'less' value tothe product at the final 2 sprints.
   * i.e. make it look pretty at the end.
